## Using the Google Cloud Speech API to perform NLP and LDA on YouTube video transcriptions


**The Challenge:**
So much of the language we process every day is heard, not written. When thinking of natural language processing, it's important to take that into account. This project serves as a proof of concept platform for accessing the *other half* of language.

 **The Toolkit:**
 * scikit-learn
 * gensim
 * numpy
 * MongoDB
 * Google Cloud Speech API


**The Results:**
The topic extraction was accurate, but not insightful. Increasing the size of the data set or using more nuanced data could yield better results. One possible idea is transcribing stand up comedy over time and grouping comedians by time or topics.
